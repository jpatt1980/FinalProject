# FinalProject

## Notes of issues that I came across 

-  Something was happening with the `dplyr` package on 28-29 July 2024. It worked fine over the past two weeks but then started to glitch to where I had to use `dplyr::` to force the package onto the `select`, `rename`, and `mutate` funcitons.

-  I attempted to store the raw data file in the "FinalProject/FinalProjectRawData" folder, but Docker wasn't being too cooperative. For time expediency, I pulled it back up into the main folder so that Docker would read it.
