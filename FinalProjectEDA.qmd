## Diabetes Health Indicators - EDA

### Introduciton

1. Briefly describe the data and variables we have to work with (only the ones that will be investigated.used in analysis)

2. De3scribe the purpose of the EDA and ultimate goal of modeling

### Data

1. Use relavtive path to import the data
```{r Import, parse, and frame the data set}
# Use a relative path to import the data. Convert variables to factors with 
# meaningful names

```

2. Check for missingness, etc. 

### Summarizations

1. Produce meaningful summary stats and plots about the data being analyzed, particularly with how the variables relate to the response

2. Do EDA on the complete data set

3. Ensure narratives explain what we are exploring and what the summaries/graphs created say about the relationships in the data
